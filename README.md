# VectorField

Python codes for handling vector field capable of

- basic visualisation
- creation of gradient and hamiltonian vector fields from a potential function
- Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition (HHD)
- interpolation of sparse observations by radial basis functions (RBF)
- interpolation of a hamiltonian vector field by Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNN)
- vector field generation from two point clouds via optimal transport
- eigen functions for the Koopman operator
